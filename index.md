## 🧭 About Me
I'm Tanmay — a curious mind wandering through engineering, philosophy, human psychology, and the occasional anime binge that becomes way too philosophical at 2 AM.

Here’s what drives me:
- Deep thinking  
- Logical analysis  
- Eastern philosophy (Vedanta)  
- Anime like *Monster*, *Jujutsu Kaisen*, *Demon Slayer*  
- Understanding how the mind works
